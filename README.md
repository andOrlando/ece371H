# Jailbreak Output Checker 🔐
We built this project because we were interested in the Crescendo jailbreak attack. It's where an attacker starts with seemingly benign prompts that gradually turn into prohibited topics. 
We wanted to come up with a way to prevent these types of attacks.

# Methods
We used two models: a main model that prints the output and a checker model that looks at the entire output and determines its safety.
